% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
  % IEEE Computer Society needs nocompress option
  % requires cite.sty v4.0 or later (November 2003)
  \usepackage[nocompress]{cite}
\else
  % normal IEEE
  \usepackage{cite}
\fi
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.
%
% Note that some packages require special options to format as the Computer
% Society requires. In particular, Computer Society  papers do not use
% compressed citation ranges as is done in typical IEEE papers
% (e.g., [1]-[4]). Instead, they list every citation separately in order
% (e.g., [1], [2], [3], [4]). To get the latter we need to load the cite
% package with the nocompress option which is supported by cite.sty v4.0
% and later. Note also the use of a CLASSOPTION conditional provided by
% IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later.

% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:

% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
\else
  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a sans serif font rather
% than the serif font used in traditional IEEE formatting and thus the need
% to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending on whether
% compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/dblfloatfix/




%\ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff
%  \usepackage[nomarkers]{endfloat}
% \let\MYoriglatexcaption\caption
% \renewcommand{\caption}[2][\relax]{\MYoriglatexcaption[#2]{#2}}
%\fi
% endfloat.sty was written by James Darrell McCauley, Jeff Goldberg and
% Axel Sommerfeldt. This package may be useful when used in conjunction with
% IEEEtran.cls'  captionsoff option. Some IEEE journals/societies require that
% submissions have lists of figures/tables at the end of the paper and that
% figures/tables without any captions are placed on a page by themselves at
% the end of the document. If needed, the draftcls IEEEtran class option or
% \CLASSINPUTbaselinestretch interface can be used to increase the line
% spacing as well. Be sure and use the nomarkers option of endfloat to
% prevent endfloat from "marking" where the figures would have been placed
% in the text. The two hack lines of code above are a slight modification of
% that suggested by in the endfloat docs (section 8.4.1) to ensure that
% the full captions always appear in the list of figures/tables - even if
% the user used the short optional argument of \caption[]{}.
% IEEE papers do not typically make use of \caption[]'s optional argument,
% so this should not be an issue. A similar trick can be used to disable
% captions of packages such as subfig.sty that lack options to turn off
% the subcaptions:
% For subfig.sty:
% \let\MYorigsubfloat\subfloat
% \renewcommand{\subfloat}[2][\relax]{\MYorigsubfloat[]{#2}}
% However, the above trick will not work if both optional arguments of
% the \subfloat command are used. Furthermore, there needs to be a
% description of each subfigure *somewhere* and endfloat does not add
% subfigure captions to its list of figures. Thus, the best approach is to
% avoid the use of subfigure captions (many IEEE journals avoid them anyway)
% and instead reference/explain all the subfigures within the main caption.
% The latest version of endfloat.sty and its documentation can obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/endfloat/
%
% The IEEEtran \ifCLASSOPTIONcaptionsoff conditional can also be used
% later in the document, say, to conditionally put the References on a
% page by themselves.




% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/url/
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.





% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***

Main Contribution:

1. We develop a united representation of intersection lines between CSG primitives. Under this representation, Face re-tessellation and classification can be done robustly in any degenerate cases by our pipeline, while keeping good performance.

2. Unlike any of the previous method, during the algorithm, we conduct point-in-polyhedron tests only on single seed vertex. We develop a propagating to spread the classification information from the seed vertex into the whole CSG. In addition, because of this, we do not need to build a full space division to accelerate point-in-polyhedron tests, which is usually time-consuming.

Our method follows the paradigm of two-step Boolean operation---intersection detection and facet classification, together with an extra step of pre-computation to accelerate the intersection detection. The main feature of our method is that we design a unified representation of intersection between primitives (U-rep) to control the complexity of intersection detection result and simplify the facet classification. Also, plane-based representation is applied throughout the methods to ensure no error introduced. For the same reason, we compute indicator vectors of vertices rather than of the barycenter of facets during classification and deduce the facets' indicator vectors from its vertices'.

\subsection{Space division}

This step is the mainly the preparation for intersection detection. As intersection detection is performed between each pair of faces, localization is necessary for acceleration by filtering invalid pairs. In general, any space division data structure can be applied in this stage. For simplicity, our method uses the adaptive octree. The implementation is akin to the implementation in ?? et al.'s method \cite{feito2015fast}. Intersection between triangle faces and octree leaves can be efficiently detected using the separating axis theorem \cite{gottschalk1996obbtree}. Octree leaves are classified into two types: if all faces that intersect a leaf belong to the same primitive, we call it a \emph{non-critical cell}. Otherwise, it is a \emph{critical cell}. The big difference between our construction method and ??'s is the subdivision termination condition. In ??'s method,??. However, in our method, we do not need subdivide any non-critical cell no matter how many faces it contains. This is because subdividing non-critical cells benefits only the polyhedron inclusion test, which is frequently used in ??'s method but rarely in ours. This simplification can bring large performance advantage, especially for those cases whose intersection areas are small.

\subsection{Intersection detection}

The goal of this step isIntersection detection is performed between pairs of triangle faces within each critical cell. For the sake of robustness, all degenerated cases should be classified and well-handled.

\section{Construction of United Intersection Graph }

The intersection of primitives can be very complex because of so many degenerate cases. In order to design a robust algorithm, one have to take into consideration of all the degenerated cases, which often makes the algorithm rather complex and error-prone to implement. We observe the important fact that the CSG evaluation is no more than splitting and selecting faces. Therefore, the only important thing during intersection test is to find out the potential edges and vertices of the result mesh. Therefore, we use a very concise graph model, with only a few extra data for classification on vertices, as the output of this stage.


Another problem is that numerical error introduced by computing coordinates of intersection vertices often leads to fault topology construction in the later stage. Using high precision float point is the most common way to alleviate this issue. However, only the time-consuming rational number arithmetic can be absolutely precise.

\begin{figure}

  \includegraphics[width=1.5in]{p-reps}\\
  \caption{Plane-based representation of triangles. The yellow triangle is represented by three bounding planes (green) and the supporting plane where the triangle lies. }\label{fig_p-reps}
\end{figure}

 In order to be both robust and efficient, we choose not to compute the coordinates of intersection vertices until we finally construct the result topology. In the early stage, each new vertex is represented by intersection of three planes. This method is based on two facts: 1) Douze et al. [] observe that every intersected vertex is either the intersection between an edge and a plane, or the intersection of three planes. 2) Campen et al. [] give an efficient method to precisely convert b-reps mesh into its plane-based representation (Fig. \ref{fig_p-reps}). Details is explained in the following.


\subsection{Definition}

Faces in a certain primitive can be classified into intersected faces and non-intersected ones according to whether they intersect other primitives. Our United Intersection Graph (UI-graph) is a graph data structure embedded in each intersected face. It is used to split these faces and guide the face classification.

The nodes of UI-graph of an intersected face $F$ are the vertices, include the original three corners of $F$ and all the intersected vertices within $F$. Intersected vertices are shared between different UI-graphs. For example, the vertex $a$ is generated by intersection between face $F_1$ from primitive $P_i$ and edge $e(G_1, G_2)$ from primitive $P_j$, where $e(G_1, G_2)$  is the shared edge of face $G_1$ and face $G_2$. Then face $F_1$, $G_1$, $G_2$ are all intersected faces and each of them contains a UI-graph with one of its node is $a$.

Douze et al. [] observed that vertices during a CSG evaluation can be divided into three types. The first order vertex is already contained in the input primitives. The second order vertex is the intersection between an edge and a face. The third vertex results from intersection of three faces from different primitives. Considering the degenerate cases, this classification is not complete because different types do overlap. But it does not matter because each vertex at least belong to one of these types. Then we can use the plane-based representation (Fig. \ref{fig_p-reps}) introduced by Campen et al.[], which treats each triangle face by a supporting plane surrounded by three bounding planes, to represent each vertex by intersection of three planes. This method has two advantages. First, it is universal for all kinds of vertices, thus is easy to handle. Second, we can avoid explicitly computing the coordinates of new introduced vertices to avoid introducing numerical error.

Also, each node contains data structure called vertex context. It records on which primitives and on which part of primitive the node lies. A vertex can lies on the vertex, edge or within the face of a certain primitive. For example, the vertex context of $a$ is $\{(F_1, P_i), (e(G_1, G_2), P_j)\}$. This information is very important for the classification of the neighborhood. In particular, we notice that the vertex context of a certain vertex is invariant in different UI-graphs. So we only need to maintain one context for each vertex and shared among UI-graphs.

The edges of UI-graph are simply the intersection line segments between faces of different primitives. They are represented by two references of the nodes in the UI-graph. No further information is required.

As will explained below, we take two steps to construct UI-graphs for each intersected faces of the whole CSG. The first step is to build stand-alone UI-graphs for each pair of primitives, which is built upon our plane-based triangle-triangle intersection test, and the second step is to merge them into a single one for each intersected faces.

\subsection{Plane-Based Triangle-Triangle Intersection}

\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=3.0in]{projection}
\caption{$Seg_1$ is the intersection between $S_2$ and $F_1$. $Seg_2$ is the intersection between $S_1$ and $F_2$. The intersection between $F_1$ and $F_2$, which is the line segment in red, is the overlap of $Seg_1$ and $Seg_2$.}
\label{fig_projection}
\end{figure}


The plane-based triangle-triangle intersection (PTTI) test is largely the variant of M\"{o}ller's triangle intersection test []. M\"{o}ller's algorithm computes the intersection between two triangles $F_1$ and $F_2$ in three steps, as illustrated in Fig. \ref{fig_projection}. First, an early rejection is performed by testing whether $F_1$ intersects the plane where $F_2$ lies, which is denoted as $S_2$. This is a necessary condition of intersection between $F_1$ and $F_2$. If this test is passed, then the same is performed for $F_2$ and $S_1$, where $S_1$ is the plane of $F_1$. Second, the intersection between $F_1$ and $S_2$, denoted as $Seg_1$, and the intersection between $F_2$ and $S_1$, denoted as $Seg_2$, are separately computed . At last, the intersection between $F_1$ and $F_2$ is determined by computing the overlap area of $Seg_1$ and $Seg_2$ .

\begin{figure}[t]
  \centering
  % Requires \usepackage{graphicx}
  \includegraphics[width=3.0in]{nonrobust}\\
  \caption{The left edges of A and B (\emph{left}) are nearly but not exactly collinear. However, under usual float point arithmetic, they might be judged as collinear causing discontinuous edges in the final result (\emph{right}).}\label{fig:precision}
\end{figure}

Conventional implementations of M\"{o}ller's algorithm use vertex-based representation and usual float point arithmetic. However, this is neither exact nor robust. In Fig. \ref{fig:precision}, we illustrate a non-robust 2D case of the Boolean operation. Although implementing M\"{o}ller's algorithm with arbitrary precision arithmetic could make it robust, it is too costly for a large CSG evaluation. Actually, the non-robustness of this algorithm is from \emph{constructions} \cite{bernstein2009fast}, which compute new coordinates of geometry objects based on the known coordinates of existing ones. In M\"{o}ller's algorithm, the coordinates of $Seg_1$ and $Seg_2$ (Fig. \ref{fig_projection}) are computed as intermediate results. On the other hand, if the computation can be restricted to \emph{predicates}, which make a two or three-way decision based on known coordinates, we could quickly and robustly implement this algorithm.



Fortunately, according to Sugihara and Iri \cite{sugihara1990solid}, geometry computation of Boolean operations can be restricted to predicates using plane-based representation of polyhedra. This motivated us to integrate plane-based representation into M\"{o}ller's algorithm. Exact and efficient predicate computation is performed using precise geometry predicate techniques \cite{shewchuk1997adaptive}. Details of our implementation are shown below.

\begin{figure}
  \centering
  % Requires \usepackage{graphicx}
  \includegraphics[width=1.7in]{p-reps}\\
  \caption{Plane-based representation of triangles. The yellow triangle is represented by three bounding planes (green) and the supporting plane where the triangle lies.}\label{fig:p-reps}
\end{figure}

We first convert $F_1$ and $F_2$ into their respective plane-based representations: a supporting plane surrounded by three bounding planes (Fig. \ref{fig:p-reps}). We implement this conversion using the exact conversion method by Campen and Kobbelt \cite{campen2010exact}. Then, in our implementation, the relative position of a point and a plane can be determined by computing the sign of the multiplication of determinants \cite{sugihara1990solid}. To avoid introducing errors, we represent the end points of $Seg_1$ and $Seg_2$  by intersections of plane triples, rather than by directly computing their coordinates. As illustrated in Fig. \ref{fig:isect}(a), these points are the intersection between an edge line of a face and the supporting plane of the other face. Because the edge line of $F_1$ can be represented as $[S_1, S_X]$ (or $[S_2, S_X]$ for an edge line of $F_2$), where $S_X$ is the corresponding bounding plane of the edge, the end points of $Seg_1$ or $Seg_2$ can be represented in the form of $[S_1,S_2,S_X]$. In Fig. \ref{fig:isect}, we list all non-coplanar intersection situations between a triangle and a plane, and the $S_X$  in each situation.


\begin{figure}[t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=3.5in]{sign}
\caption{We denote the signed distance from point $X$ to plane $S_2$ as $d_X$. All the four non-coplanar conditions of intersection between $F_1$ and $S_2$ (denoted as $Seg_1$) are:  (a) $d_A\cdot d_C<0$, $d_B\cdot d_C<0$; (b) $d_A=0$, $d_B=0$, $d_C\neq 0$; (c) $d_A=0$, $d_B\cdot d_C<0$; (d) $d_A=0$, $d_B\cdot d_C>0$. End points of $Seg_1$ are intersections between $S_2$ and related edge lines of $F_1$ (bold edges).}
\label{fig:isect}
\end{figure}


The intersection between $F_1$ and $F_2$ is the overlap area of $Seg_1$ and $Seg_2$. It can be easily computed by comparing the end points of $Seg_1$ and $Seg_2$ along $L$ (Fig. \ref{fig_projection}), where $L$ is the intersection between $S_1$ and $S_2$. Unlike M\"{o}ller's implementation, our approach uses no projection, which requires the exact point coordinates. We call the direction of vector $\vec{N}_1\times \vec{N}_2$ the positive direction, where $\vec{N}_1$ and $\vec{N}_2$ are normals of $S_1$ and $S_2$ respectively. Given two points $A$ and $B$ on $L$,  we compute the sign of the multiplication of determinants:

where $\vec{S}_X$ is the coefficient vector of plane equation $[a_X,b_X,c_X,d_X]$,  and $ \vec{N}_X$ is the normal vector $[a_X,b_X,c_X]$. If $K(A, B)$ is positive (negative), this means that $A$ lies in the positive (negative) direction of $B$. Otherwise, $A$ and $B$ are coincident.

One may find that we do not give the solution of coplanar cases. This is deliberate because we find recording coplanar cases is not necessary for the following process. This will be discussed further in Section 5.


\subsection{Generating Pairwise UI-Graphs}

As a general case, an intersected face intersects with one or more primitives. This means there could be so many different types of degenerate cases, that it is not easy

we choose divide and conquer \cite{ogayar2005point} \cite{douze2015quickcsg}

We first consider constructing UI-graph between each pair of primitives. The graph generated by two primitives is much simpler than a n-primitive one: since input primitives are not self-intersected, there is no cross or overlap between intersection line segments.

When PTTI test detects a intersection, it outputs the two end points of intersection line segment, or, in a degenerate case, two coincident points.


\subsection{Merging UI-Graphs}

Mainly deal with intersection between intersection line segments. It is necessary when a face intersects with faces from more than one other primitives.


Atom operation:

1. add an vertex. no need outside a graph

2. remove/add edges.

3. sort along an edge.

4. merge vertices.

comparison:

 If coplanar (collinear), choose a direction as positive. 3-4-2
 If not, compute intersection, 4-2

\label{section:floodfill}

Flood-filling is all about giving a seed and propagation. In this chapter, from down to top, we introduce this process and explain how it can save computation time.

\subsection{Background}
\label{sec:intuitive}

\subsection{Flood-filling Inside a Triangle}

\subsubsection{Compute indicator vector}

How to propagate the indicator vector from the seed vertex to all the vertex in a triangle.

Start from a full indicator

\subsubsection{Facet classification}

How to generate new face and classify faces using indicator vector.

\subsubsection{Acceleration}

How to reuse the indicator vector of neighbouring vertex.

\subsubsection{Coplanar degenerate case}

Special case discussion, mainly for coplanar problem.

\subsubsection{Acceleration}


\section{Experiments and Discussion}


\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we proposed a novel method to evaluate CSG with triangular mesh primitives. It is able to efficiently perform non-incremental evaluation of large CSG with massive faces. The key idea of our approach is to use the local coherence of face space labels to accelerate face membership classification. A two-level grouping framework is developed to group neighboring faces together and thus space labels can be shared within each group. This scheme saves much time for space label computation, which is often very time-consuming for conventional Boolean evaluation algorithms. Additionally, in order to be robust, plane-based geometry computation is introduced into the intersection computation step of our approach. Experiments have verified the proposed approach is more efficient than the state-of-the-art techniques while retaining robustness and stability. We will further investigate the robust tessellation in future.
